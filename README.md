# Iptables_Semantics

A formal semantics of the Linux netfilter iptables firewall.
Written in the [Isabelle](https://isabelle.in.tum.de/) interactive proof assistant.

It features
  * A real-world model of IPv4/IPv6 addresses as 32bit/128bit machine words.
  * Executable code.
  * Support for all common actions in the iptables filter table: ACCEPT, DROP, REJECT, LOG, calling to user-defined chains, RETURN, GOTO to terminal chains, the empty action.
  * Support for ALL primitive match conditions (by abstracting over unknown match conditions).
  * Translation to a simplified firewall model.
  * Certification of spoofing protection.
  * Service Matrices: For a fixed port, which IP addresses are allowed to connect which other IP addresses? Shows a partition of the complete IPv4/IPv6 addresses.
  * ...

## Isabelle Theory Files

The theory files are compatible with Isabelle 2016-1-RC2.

Checking all proofs:

```
$ isabelle build -v -D . -o document=pdf
```
This needs about 14 CPU hours (about 7 hours real time on an x220, i7 2.7GHz, 16GB ram).
The session `Iptables_Semantics_Examples_Large1` needs about 5-6 hours CPU time and `Iptables_Semantics_Examples_Large2` needs about 7 hours of CPU time; you may want to skip those.


Building the documentation:

```
$ isabelle build -d . -v -o document=pdf Iptables_Semantics_Documentation
```
The build takes less than 10 minutes on my laptop (14min CPU time, 2 threads).
The documentation summarizes the most important definitions and theorems.
It is deliberately very very brief and only provides results.
It should contain the summarizing correctness theorems for all executable functions we export.
This is probably the best point to get started working with the theory files.


To develop, we suggest to load the Bitmagic theory as heap-image:
```
$ isabelle jedit -d . -l Bitmagic
```

Check the Examples directory to get started
