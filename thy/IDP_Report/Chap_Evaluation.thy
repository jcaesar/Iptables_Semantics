chapter\<open>Evaluation\<close>
text\<open>The previous chapter considered all aspects merely from a theoretical standpoint. 
  This chapter will evaluate the changes on a practical level.
  We will begin with a few toy examples that demonstrate in what kind of cases interface rewriting
  is useful when generating service matrices. After that, we show \todo{two} real-world examples
  of improvements of service matrices through interface rewriting.
In Section~\ref{sec:evalloft}, we provide the first evaluation of LOFT~\cite{LOFT-AFP} based on real-world data.
