Cheating: we removed
-A CouldBeSpoofed -s 0.0.0.0/32 -d 255.255.255.255/32 -p udp -m udp --sport 67:68 --dport 67:68 -j RETURN
from the raw table.

14.15.16.* is a redacted IP address. While we don't consider this cheating,
the choice is not completely arbitrary: for transforming to openflow, we have
to move all IPs into the same network. Had we, e.g., chosen 51.52.53.*, the
network address (lowest address) of the smallest common network would be
0.0.0.0. This causes mininet not to add the route for that interface for the
test-clients attached to the openflow switch, presumably a bug in iproute2.

Another note:
We've deleted a routing rule
255.255.255.0 dev vpriv proto kernel scope link src 10.13.37.200
from the live device configuration before dumping since it's not required.
This rule was automatically added by OpenVPN. It is not clear to us which
purpose this rule should serve, and it seems to be an artifact.
